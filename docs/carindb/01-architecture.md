## 1. File System Architecture (ISO Volume)

Standard ISO 9660 image, **2048 bytes/logical sector** (`4385374208 / 2048 = 2141296` exact).
No Mode 2 Form 2 / subheader: extracted files are already pure "user data".

> `carinet16s512` in ABSTRACT independently confirms the CARIN addressing unit is **512** bytes ("s512").

> **CD discs differ.** On CD (e.g. Carminat CNI1, CD-IDs 2952 and 21594):
> - the database is a single `/carindb` file;
> - there is no `DB_0`/`DB_1` split;
> - the addressing unit is **2048** bytes. CD-ID 21594's ABSTRACT reads `carinet16s2048`.
>
> `BLOCK_ID >> 8` counts 2048-byte sectors and `UNCOMPRESSED_SIZE` counts 2048-byte sectors too. With that unit, the block chain covers 100% of the file with no gaps on both CDs; with 512 it breaks after the first block.
>
> **Not every CD counts in 2048-byte sectors.** A third CD, a Master CD from about 2007 with DB-REL 34 (single `/carindb` of 392,500,224 bytes, ABSTRACT `Event Texts: carinet16s512.20041130`), counts `BLOCK_ID >> 8` in **512-byte** sectors: the chain covers the file with 766,602 sectors and 76,863 blocks (24,989 of type `0x00`), while with 2048 it finds only three chance hits. As on the DVDs, the ABSTRACT names the unit, but reading it is not needed: `CarinVolume.probe_sector_size` counts the block headers in the first 4 MiB under each unit and takes 512 only when it finds clearly more (at least 8 and more than twice as many as with 2048); otherwise it keeps 2048. Pass `sector_size=` to override. A bare `carindb` file extracted from a disc opens with `carin.parser.iso.open_image` / `RawImage`.

> **CD-i Bridge, and burning a modified CD** (CD-ID 2952, the disc the Renault CNI1 takes;
> tested on the unit 2026-09-28/29).
> - The CD is a **CD-i Bridge** disc, not a plain ISO. CD-i Bridge (White Book) is built on CD-i
>   (Green Book) so that the same disc also works as a CD-ROM XA disc in a CD-ROM drive. The PVD's
>   system identifier
>   is `CD-RTOS CD-BRIDGE` (volume `NAV_DB`, set `CARIN`, application `CDI/PD`) and every
>   sector is CD-ROM XA **Mode 2** with an 8-byte CD-i subheader (Form 1 data: submode `0x08`,
>   `0x88` on the last sector of a file).
> - Root files: `ABSTRACT` ("This CD-BRIDGE formatted disc contains a digital road map database
>   for the CARiN navigation system…"), `BIBLIOGR` (`CD-ID 2952`, `DB-REL 22`,
>   `BSW-REL 91.0 91.1 92.5 … 94.3`, CR-separated; the same fields as the DVD's), `COPYRIGH`, the
>   `CDI` directory with the CD-i boot program `CDI/PD`, and `carindb` (from LBA 2274).
> - **Burning a changed disc.** Edit the raw image (2,352-byte sectors), recompute the EDC and the
>   P and Q ECC of every changed sector (Mode 2 Form 1: the address field is zeroed for the ECC,
>   and P is written before Q, which reads it), and burn the image raw with a TOC that declares
>   `CD_ROM_XA` and `TRACK MODE2_RAW`, e.g. `cdrdao write --device /dev/sr0 --speed 8 --eject
>   X.toc`. Rip with `cdrdao read-cd --read-raw --driver generic-mmc-raw`. Every disc tested on the
>   CNI1 was made this way (8×, Maxell and LOGIK CD-Rs). An ordinary ISO burn writes Mode 1
>   sectors without the CD-i subheaders; that was not tested.
> - The subheader's file and channel numbers don't seem to matter: a disc with CD-ID 21594's
>   `carindb` inside CD-ID 2952's CD-i shell, whose `carindb` sectors carry file 0 / channel 0
>   instead of 1 / 1, works fully. The disc also keeps CD-ID 2952's `BIBLIOGR` (`DB-REL 22`)
>   around the DB-REL 34 database, so the CNI1 doesn't check those values against `carindb`.
>   CD-ID 21594 as issued is a Mode 1 disc; whether the CNI1 accepts that format was not
>   established (the copy tried was a bad burn).
> - `carindb` may grow: the `CDI` directory and `CDI/PD` can move behind it once the PVD volume
>   size, both path tables and the root and `CDI` directory records are patched (tested on the
>   CNI1 with a copied `0x00` tile appended to `carindb`).
> - The CC-93 firmware in the repo runs on OS-9/68K, the system CD-i's CD-RTOS is built on, so
>   CD-i Bridge discs are plausibly the CARiN CD format in general; only the CNI1 was tested.

### 1.1 Virtual Address Space `DB_0` + `DB_1`

`DB_0` and `DB_1` form **a single sector space**. Each file spans a window of
`0x400000` sectors (= 2 GiB):

```
virtual_sector      = file_index * 0x400000 + local_sector
byte_offset_in_file = local_sector * 512
```

| File | Virtual Sectors | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DB_0` | `0x000000` .. `0x3FFED6` (0..4,194,198) | |
| *(hole)* | `0x3FFED7` .. `0x3FFFFF` (105 sectors) | **does not exist on disc**: 2 GiB alignment padding |
| `DB_1` | `0x400000` .. `0x62FFFB` (4,194,304..6,489,787) | first block: `BLOCK_ID = 0x4000002B` |

Proof: first sector of `DB_1` declares `BLOCK_ID.sector = 0x400000`. All block
pointers (e.g. `0x6273EC01` in block 3) resolve correctly only under this rule.

### 1.2 Physical Layout by Block Type

The block chain covers **100%** of both files (315,095 blocks, no gaps),
ordered in contiguous regions by type:

## 2. Generic Block Structure

Each block starts on a 512-byte boundary:

```
+0x00  BLOCK_ID          u32   (sector << 8) | length_in_sectors
+0x04  BLOCK_TYPE        u16
+0x06  COMPRESSION_FLAG  u8
+0x07  UNCOMPRESSED_SIZE u8    decompressed size in 512 B sectors (header included)
+0x08  SECTION_DESCRIPTOR[N]   N * { u16 offset, u16 count }
 ...   SERVICE_DATA            (block-type specific, up to the first section offset)
 ...   SECTION_0 .. SECTION_N-1
```

**Golden rule for offsets:** every `offset` in the descriptor, and every internal
pointer within the block, is **relative to the start of the *decompressed* block,
8-byte header included**. Therefore `payload_index = offset - 8`.

### 2.1 `COMPRESSION_FLAG`

| Value | Codec | Blocks | Verification |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| `0` | no compression | 15,984 | payload used as-is |
| `1` | **structure-aware bit-packing** | 96,011 | resolved → [`04-cf1-codec.md`](04-cf1-codec.md). Not dictionary compression: bit-packed fields parameterized by the superblock's `RECORD_SIZE_TABLE`. Predominant in types `0x00`,`0x15`,`0x16`,`0x1C`,`0x14`,`0x1D` |
| `2` | **zlib / RFC 1950** (`78 DA`) | 203,100 | `zlib.decompress(raw[8:])` yields exactly `us*512 - 8` bytes |

For `cf==2` the zlib stream starts **immediately after the 8-byte header**; the
section descriptor is *inside* the compressed payload.

### 2.2 Compiler Write Constraint

`UNCOMPRESSED_SIZE` is 8-bit ⇒ a block cannot exceed **255 sectors (130,560 bytes)**
once decompressed. Maximum observed: 96 sectors (49,152 bytes) — the original
compiler limits blocks to ~48 KiB. `BLOCK_ID.length` is 8-bit ⇒ max 255 sectors on
disc; max observed 70.

### 2.3 Python Struct

```python
import struct, zlib
from dataclasses import dataclass

SECTOR = 512
WINDOW = 0x400000          # sectors per DB_n file (2 GiB)

BLOCK_HDR = ">IHBB"        # BLOCK_ID, BLOCK_TYPE, COMPRESSION_FLAG, UNCOMPRESSED_SIZE
BLOCK_HDR_SIZE = 8         # struct.calcsize(BLOCK_HDR) == 8

SECTION_DESC = ">HH"       # offset, count   (offset relative to block start, header included)

@dataclass
class CarinBlock:
    sector: int            # absolute virtual sector
    length: int            # length on disc, in 512 B sectors
    type: int              # BLOCK_TYPE
    comp: int              # 0 = raw, 1 = bit-packed (CF=1), 2 = zlib
    usize: int             # decompressed size in 512 B sectors
    data: bytes            # decompressed block, 8-byte header included

    @classmethod
    def parse(cls, raw: bytes, sector: int) -> "CarinBlock":
        bid, btype, cf, us = struct.unpack_from(BLOCK_HDR, raw)
        if (bid >> 8) != sector:
            raise ValueError(f"BLOCK_ID sector {bid >> 8:#x} != {sector:#x}")
        length = bid & 0xFF
        if cf == 2:
            body = zlib.decompress(raw[BLOCK_HDR_SIZE:length * SECTOR])
        elif cf == 0:
            body = raw[BLOCK_HDR_SIZE:length * SECTOR]
        else:
            body = cf1.decode_block(raw, layout_table, db_rel)[BLOCK_HDR_SIZE:]   # see 04-cf1-codec.md
        return cls(sector, length, btype, cf, us, raw[:BLOCK_HDR_SIZE] + body)

    def sections(self, n: int):
        """n = number of descriptor entries (depends on BLOCK_TYPE, see 03-road-network.md §6)."""
        out = []
        for i in range(n):
            off, cnt = struct.unpack_from(SECTION_DESC, self.data, BLOCK_HDR_SIZE + 4 * i)
            out.append((off, cnt))
        return out

    def section_bytes(self, off: int, end: int) -> bytes:
        return self.data[off:end]          # offsets are already absolute within the block

def pack_block_id(sector: int, length: int) -> int:
    assert 1 <= length <= 255
    return (sector << 8) | length
```

---

## 3. Superblock — Root Block (Sector 0, `BLOCK_TYPE = 0x12`)

Absolute offset `0x00000000`, 1 sector (512 bytes), uncompressed.
The root **does not** contain pointers to "Node/Edge/Name tables": it holds the
database *schema*.

> **FIRMWARE INSIGHT (0x12 ROOT BLOCK)**: 
> The `SERVICE_DATA` is actually an array of 8-byte structures (`{u32 BLOCK_ID, u16 offset, u16 count}`). This struct layout is defined by a C-struct `GlobalBlockHeader` shared with other directory blocks (like `0x08`).
> The routing engine (`rpmod.asm:01b122` and clones in `dbq`, `dbpa`, `pbp`) accesses this block **exclusively** to read the `DB-REL` and the Record Size Table (RST). It reads `DB-REL` via a hardcoded offset at `+0x1A`. It reads the RST offset/count at `+0x28` / `+0x2A`. 
> All other fields in this array (e.g. `+0x1C`, `+0x24`, `+0x2C..+0x5F`) are **DEAD DATA** (ignored compiler artifacts from the shared struct) and are never read by the query engine.
> Furthermore, `rpmod` adds the `+0x28` offset (`0x00A6`) directly to the base pointer, completely **bypassing** `SECTION_0` at `+0x60`. `SECTION_0` and the `BLOCK_TYPE_LIST` are not parsed by the routing engine's RST override logic.

```

The superblock **spans sectors 0 and 1** (1024 bytes) despite declaring `length = 1`.
Sector 1 (`0x200`) is the tail of `RECORD_SIZE_TABLE` and has no header of its own.
**This is the only observed exception to the chaining rule** — when reading the
root, pass ≥1024 bytes and do NOT truncate to `length*512`.

Note. Rectangular (non-square) coverage areas A and B are absent in my DB-REL 30 (russian). And `coverage areaA` and `coverage areaB` may differ each other, not '(identical to 0x34)', verified on DB-REL 34: CD-ID 21425 (1. BNL_13_14), CD-ID 19629 (NAV_DB_Russia.iso). 


### 3.2 `RECORD_SIZE_TABLE` (verified extract)

Pairs `(section_type, record_size_bytes)` starting at `0x00A6`. **This table
parameterizes the CF=1 decoder** — see [`04-cf1-codec.md`](04-cf1-codec.md) §9.11.3.

> **RESOLVED (Dual Module Architecture: `db_pub` vs `rpmod`)**:
> The `RECORD_SIZE_TABLE` is read and handled independently by the two major modules of the OS-9 navigation stack, each with its own private Global Data Area (GDA, register `a6`):
>
> 1. **Map-Rendering (`pbp` / `db_pub`)**:
>    - Copies the disc's `RECORD_SIZE_TABLE` into its private static area at base offset `-$71cc(a6)`.
>    - Reads entry `idx` via `-(0x71cc - 2*idx)(a6)`.
>    - Hardcodes which section indices to use for rendering blocks:
>      - `0x00`: `T[0x05]`, `T[0x06]`, `T[0x08]`, `T[0x09]`, `T[0x0B]`, `T[0x0C]`, `T[0x0F]`, `T[0x10]`, `T[0x12]`, `T[0x13]`, `T[0x14]`, `T[0x15]`, `T[0x40]`, `T[0x4C]`, `T[0x59]`.
>      - `0x0E`: `T[0x2B]`, `T[0x2D]`, `T[0x41]`, `T[0x42]`, etc.
>      - `0x14`–`0x16`, `0x1C`–`0x1E`: `T[0x05]`, `T[0x15]`, `T[0x3A]`, `T[0x3B]`, `T[0x3C]`, `T[0x3D]`, `T[0x3F]`, `T[0x59]`.
>    - **Non-rendering blocks (`0x10`, `0x12`, etc.)**: In the dispatcher at `0x3698`, blocks `> 0x0E` not handled by dedicated decoders branch to `0x36d2`. Here, `pbp` calculates `size = sectors * 2048`, sets `val = 0`, and calls `bsr.w $6a06` (`memset(dest, 0, size)`), simply zeroing the buffer because the map renderer does not draw them.
>
> 2. **Routing Engine (`rpmod`)**:
>    - Operates in its own distinct GDA where the table base is **`-$7ee8(a6)`** with cell offset `-$7ee8 + (ID * 2)`.
>    - **Factory Defaults**: Subroutine `01af8a` pre-loads 66 hardcoded default constants for IDs `0x01` to `0x42` (from `-$7ee6(a6)` to `-$7e64(a6)`).
>    - **Dynamic Disc Override**: Subroutine `01b122` parses the Superblock. It reads `DB-REL` at `+0x1A`. If `DB-REL >= 18` (`0x12`), it reads descriptor `+0x28` `{u16 offset, u16 count}` and dynamically **overrides** the table cells in RAM (`move.w $2(a1), (a0, d0.l * 2)`) with the values from the disc's `RECORD_SIZE_TABLE` for all entries with `ID <= 0x42` (66 decimal).
>    - The rest of `rpmod` relies on this table (over 100 read occurrences) for record stride multiplication, division to calculate element counts (`divs.l d0, d1`), and parcel navigation. Entries with `ID > 0x42` (e.g. `0x4C`, `0x59`) are ignored by `rpmod`.

See §3.2.1 below for the full `BLOCK_TYPE → section_type[]` mapping. Types not covered by the CF=1 codec
(0x06, 0x09, 0x0C, 0x10) are documented empirically in [`03-road-network.md`](03-road-network.md) §6.

### 3.2.1 `BLOCK_TYPE → section_type[]` (recovered from firmware)

**Verification rule**: every confirmed row requires ≥ 2 independent sources
(firmware T[] reference + RST cross-check + optional empirical). Unverified
entries are marked `[HYP]`.

#### BLOCK_TYPE `0x00` — map drawing (CF=1 / CF=0)

N = 15 descriptor entries (`e0..e14`) in DB-REL 34; 13 in CC-93 (`e0..e12`).
Bbox at offset `0x44`. Source: `docs/fw/mips_decode_type00.asm`,
`docs/fw/mips_dec_B.asm`, `carin/parser/cf1.py`.

Structural T-table entries used by the type `0x00` CF=1 decoder (not section
record sizes): `0x05`=8 (descriptor base offset), `0x09`=26 (S4 tail-field
offset), `0x11`=60 (internal width).

#### BLOCK_TYPE `0x0E` — road parcels (CF=1 / CF=2)

N = 4 descriptor entries (`e0..e3`). No bbox. Source: `docs/fw/pbp_0x0E_decoder.asm`,
`carin/parser/cf1.py`, `scripts/oracle_0e.py` (67/67 blocks validated).

| slot | section_type | record_size | sources |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| prologue (verbatim) | `0x2b` | 48 B (40 on DB-REL 22) | firmware `T[0x2b]`, RST[0x2b]=48 |

| S1 (`e1`) | `0x41` | 6 B (4 on DB-REL 22) | firmware `T[0x41]`, RST[0x41]=6, CF=1 empirical; read it from the table |
| S2 (`e2`) | `0x42` | 24 B | firmware `T[0x42]`, RST[0x42]=24, CF=1 empirical |

S2 record layout: `+0` i32 X, `+4` i32 Y = centre of the linked `0x00` tile;
`+8..+14` 4×u16 = even low/high and odd low/high house numbers (`0x7FFF` = none);
`+16` u32 `BLOCK_ID` of the `0x00` tile; `+20` u16 byte offset into its SECTION_4;
`+22` u16 SECTION_4 record count. S0 `A` points to the street name and `C` (if
non-zero) to a locality. See `03-road-network.md` §6.3.1.

#### BLOCK_TYPE `0x14`–`0x16`, `0x1C`–`0x1E` — scale layers (CF=0 / CF=1 / CF=2)

N = 6 descriptor entries (`e0..e5`). Bbox at offset `0x20`. The RoadRunner CF=1
dispatcher sends all six types to one decoder (`db_pub` `sub_004b88`, see
[`04-cf1-codec.md`](04-cf1-codec.md) §9.11.11). Source: `carin/parser/cf1/decoder_14.py`;
oracle `scripts/routing/oracle_14_16.py` passes on every block of these types on
CD-IDs 21708 and 21734, whatever the `COMPRESSION_FLAG`.

| slot | table id | record | records | written by |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| prologue (verbatim) | `0x3d` | 52 B | — | header, descriptor, bbox `0x20`, `0x30` u16 S3 selector, `0x32` u16 S3 shift |
| S0 (`e0`) | `0x3b` | 4 B | count + 1 | category, draw flag, S1/S2 offset (`02-geo.md` §8.4) |
| S1 (`e1`) | `0x3a` | 20 B | count + 1 | areas: name, S3 offset, u32, X, Y, `+0x10` (0), `+0x12` e5 offset |
| S2 (`e2`) | `0x3c` | 16 B | count + 1 | lines: name, S3 offset, u32, `+8` e4 offset, `+0x0a` u16, `+0x0c` e5 offset, `+0x0e` u16 |
| S3 (`e3`) | — | 4 or 8 B | count | vertices: 4 B local `u16 x, y` (shift = u16 at `0x32`) when u16 at `T[0x05]+T[0x3f]+0x10` ≠ 0, else 8 B absolute `i32` |
| e4 | `0x15` | 6 B | count | 3 × u16 (DB-REL ≥ 20 pass) |
| e5 | `0x59` | 4 B | count | name offset, u8, u8 (5 bits) (DB-REL ≥ 23 pass) |
| text | — | — | — | NUL-terminated strings after the last section |

The last record of S0, S1 and S2 is a terminator: S0's points at the end of the
last of S1/S2, S1/S2's S3 offset is the end of S3, and its name and X/Y are 0. On
every CF=0 and CF=2 block of both DVDs (20,227 blocks) S3 records are
4 B (shift 6 for `0x16`, 7 `0x15`, 8 `0x1C`, 9 `0x14`, 10 `0x1D`, 11 `0x1E`), and
S1 `+8/+12` X/Y is a point on the disc but often outside the block's own bbox.
The value 4 in S1 `+0x12` / S2 `+0x0c` (below the prologue, so no section) means
"no e5 record".

#### Types with empirical record sizes only (no CF=1 decoder — `[HYP]`)

| BLOCK_TYPE | slot | section_type | record_size | notes |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| `0x06` POI | S0 (`e0`) | 0x32 | 28 B (20 B on DB-REL 22) | `02-geo.md` §8.1; only `T[0x32]` of the 5 candidates is 20 on CD-ID 2952 |
| `0x0C` | S0 (`e0`) | *confirmed* | 8 B | CF=2; Array of Bounding Boxes (Xmin, Ymin, Xmax, Ymax) |
| `0x0C` | S1 (`e1`) | *confirmed* | 24 B | CF=2; Road parcels (16B metadata + 8B local BBox) |
| `0x0C` | S3 (`e3`) | *confirmed* | 12 B | CF=2; Topology/Relation references |
| `0x0C` | S5 (`e5`) | *confirmed* | text | CF=2; String Blob (Latin-1 null-terminated) referenced by byte offset |
| `0x10` | S0 (`e0`) | `[HYP]` many | 8 B | POI index: name, type, locality, detail ptr (`02-geo.md` §8.1.1) |
| `0x10` | S1 (`e1`) | 0x2f | 40 B | POI detail: absolute X/Y + address/phone ptrs; `T[0x51]` is 28 on CD-ID 2952 |
| `0x09` | S0 (`e0`) | `[HYP]` many | 4 B | CF=0 empirical |
| `0x09` | S1 (`e1`) | - | ~488 B | CF=0 empirical; no RST match (variable-length blob) |

#### Unassigned section_type IDs

Of the 93 RST entries, **24 are confirmed** (or confirmed-structural) above;
**69 have no block_type assignment** yet:

```
01(12) 02(16) 03(8)  04(28) 07(8)  0a(6)  0d(4)  0e(48)

58(4)  5a(2)  8a(1)  97(16) 9d(22)
```

Format: `ID(size_in_bytes)`. Likely block type candidates for some IDs are noted
in `03-road-network.md` §6 (road parcels) and `02-geo.md` §8 (geo records).

**Firmware.** Mk3 0127 reads the record in two places with identical code, `rpmod+0x46ff0` (the
route planner, behind an RPC stub) and `dbq+0x213f0` (database queries). Both find the record
through S0 (`REC_OFF`) and fill a 20-byte struct: the four `+0x1C` values × 100 as u32, a byte
`+0x24 == 0` (drives on the right), a byte `+0x26 != 0`, and `COUNTRY_ID`, read only when a
version number the firmware keeps is at least `0x15` (so it is 0 on older data). In `rpmod` the
right-hand byte is read back by a caller that returns it (`rpmod+0x2761c`), and it defaults to 1
when the lookup fails. No reader of the other fields was found; they may be used through the RPC.

`ISO_CC` is not what the CNI1 displays: with CD-ID 21594 the unit shows the international
vehicle registration code "IRL" for Ireland, not "ie". The firmware maps the country to that
code itself, probably from `COUNTRY_ID`. CD-ID 2952 has no code field at all.

#### 4.4.1 `0x0D`, `0x0F` and `0x11`: name tries

Both are letter tries in the same 12-byte record format as `0x0B` (§4.3):
`u32 BLOCK_ID | u8 letter | u8 leaf | u16 offset | u16 count | u16 flags (0)`.
With `leaf` = 0 the record points to the next level (`count` records at `offset` in that
block, usually a `0x0D`/`0x11` block); with `leaf` = 1 it points to `count` consecutive name
records in the target block. The letter `@` (0x40) marks the end of a name: `ash@` is the leaf
for exactly "ash", while `ash` leads on to longer names. A range is split only while it is
large, so leaves sit at depths 1 to 18. This is how the unit offers only the letters that can
still follow.

| Trie | Root | Leaves point to | Check (`local/tools/trie0d.py`, `trie11.py`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x0D` city names | `0x0A` record `+0x00` (one per country) | `0x0C` city records (8 B, name offset first) | every leaf name starts with its prefix: United Kingdom 35,168, Ireland 62,964 (CD-ID 21594); England 26,692, Scotland 2,921 (CD-ID 2952) |
| `0x11` POI names | `0x0A` section 3 (one per country and category); `0x0C` sections 3 and 5 (per city, category and brand, §4.4.2) | `0x10` POI index records (8 B: name offset, type, locality, detail pointer) | 302 / 302 (CD-ID 21594), 187 / 187 (CD-ID 2952) |
| `0x0F` road names | `0x0C` city record `+0x00` (one per city, below) | `0x0E` section 0 street records (8 B, §6.3) | 18,848 / 18,861 names under their prefix on 200 cities (CD-ID 21594; the 13 are one Irish range where `i` and `í` sort together); 30,437 / 30,437 on 300 cities (CD-ID 2952) |

The `0x11` categories are the POIs you can search by name: 20 attractions (Guinness Storehouse,
Madame Tussauds), 32 museums, 35 stadiums, 37 landmarks (Big Ben, Newgrange), 38 theme parks,
39 national parks, 49 a museum (CD-ID 2952 only), 52 airports (with IATA codes such as `dub`
and `ork` as alias records, flag `0x0100`), 53 ferry terminals and the Channel Tunnel,
58 border crossings.

`0x11` is mostly one level deep: a first-letter index rather than a trie that narrows letter by
letter. On CD-ID 2952 all 85,313 `0x11` records are leaves; on CD-ID 21594, 143 of 437,838 lead
to a second level. A leaf's `count` records are consecutive `0x10` S0 records whose names all
start with its letter, in name order (85,232 / 85,313 in order on CD-ID 2952; the rest differ only
in `ü` / `ue` collation). The unit finds a POI through its letter's leaf and then by name within
it (§4.4.2).

**`0x0C` city records** (`local/tools/city0c.py FILE SECTOR`). Section 0 holds 8-byte entries in
alphabetical order: `u16 name offset, u16 flags, u16 post-town offset (0 = none), u16 pointer
into section 1` (e.g. `abbas itchen` → `winchester`). Section 1 records are 24 bytes on
DB-REL 34 and 20 on DB-REL 22:

```
+0x00 u32 BLOCK_ID of a 0x0F block \
+0x04 u16 offset                     |  root of the city's road-name trie
+0x06 u16 count                     /
+0x08 u16 offset into section 3, +0x0A u16 count: the city's POI index, one 12-byte
      range per POI category (§4.4.2)
+0x0C u32 BLOCK_ID of a 0x00 tile, +0x10 u16 offset in it: the city centre, used when a
      city is chosen without a road
```
Sections 3 and 5 are the cities' POI index by category and by brand (§4.4.2).

A street can be listed under more than one city, as separate `0x0E` records reached from
separate tries. On CD-ID 2952 a street on the border of two towns sits in a packed `0x0E` block
under one town and in a plain one under the neighbouring larger town. Editing one copy leaves
the other list unchanged.

**Renaming a street (tested on a CNI1, CD-ID 2952).** A street's name is stored in every city
list that carries it (plain or packed `0x0E`), in its word-reordered alias (flag `0x1000`, e.g.
`lane …`) and in the text of its `0x00` tile. Renaming all of them, keeping the new name in the
same sort position (so no trie range changes), works on the unit: the new name is listed and
selectable. An earlier rename of one copy only, which also broke that list's sort order, showed
the old name in the other city's list and crashed the unit when it was selected. Packed blocks can
be edited without re-encoding by swapping letters whose text codes have the same total bit length
(`local/tools/textsplice.py`).

A rename that moves the street to another place in the list also works, once the list is re-sorted
and the city's `0x0F` leaves are rebuilt. The rule the disc's compiler used reproduces every
city's `0x0F` trie on both CDs (49,310 and 95,543 cities; `local/tools/triebuild.py`):

1. At each level, group the sorted names by their next letter, ignoring accents (`@` when the
   name ends there). The lists are sorted the same way.
2. A group whose records all sit in one target block becomes a leaf. A group spanning several
   blocks is split again on the following letter.
3. A group gets one trie record per letter that occurs in it, all pointing at the whole group.
   `ä`, `ö` and `ü` count as letters in their own right. Any other accented letter also brings
   its plain letter, which comes first (`á` alone gives `a`, `á`).

A made-up city also works. Renaming a city in place (keeping its sort position, so the country's
`0x0D` leaf still covers it), giving its street records new names, re-encoding the packed `0x0E`
block with `encode_type0E`, and writing the city's `0x0F` root from the rule alone gives a city
that can be selected, with the new street list, and a street that can be chosen as a destination.
The unit's destination line then shows the **old** street and city names ("street, locality"):
it doesn't take them from the list that was searched, but from another copy of the road's name.
That could be the post town's `0x0E` list (where `C` gives the locality) or the `0x00` tile text,
and neither was changed. The `0x0F` rule does not rebuild the `0x0D` city tries: these split some
groups that sit in one block (open).

The destination line comes from the map: re-encoding the `0x00` tiles with `encode_type00` and
changing the street name and locality that section 2 points to (`+0` street, `+2` locality) makes
the destination screen show the new names, with the post town's initial in front of the locality
(`T.-CUSTOM` for a place whose `0x0C` post town is Truro). The same names show when the road is
picked on the map. A name blob must end on the NUL that closes its last string, as every blob on
the discs does: the unit's decode buffer is not zeroed, and without that NUL the last name ran on
into leftover bytes (`HELLO WORLD ü $°%ú`).

Once a destination with a post town is set (the `T.` in `T.-CUSTOM`), the CNI1's street
selection lists the post town's streets (its whole `0x0E` list, e.g. Truro's 1,443 entries with
their localities: `a30, blackwater`), not those of the city that was picked; picking the city
again brings its own list back. This is the unit's normal behaviour (checked on an unedited
village), so a rename meant to be found this way must also be made in the post town's list.

**Moving a block (tested on a CNI1, CD-ID 2952).** A packed `0x00` tile was copied to the end of
`carindb` (the file grew by 3 sectors; the `CDI` directory and `CDI/PD` moved up behind it, with
the root directory, the `CDI` directory, both path tables and the PVD volume size patched), its
old sectors were zeroed, and every pointer to it was rewritten. The unit draws, searches and
routes the area as before, including routes that cross into the tile. So the firmware reaches
blocks only through their `BLOCK_ID`s, never by position in the chain, and `carindb` can grow.
A scan of every block on the disc (packed ones decoded) for that tile's `BLOCK_ID` found these
pointer kinds and nothing else (`local/tools/refs.py`):

| Holder | Field | Count for this tile |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0E` street directory | S2 `+16`, the street's segment run | 29 |
| Neighbouring `0x00` tiles | slot 6 `+8`, tile-edge twin | 34 |
| Neighbouring `0x00` tiles | slot 9, neighbour list | 5 |
| `0x0C` city record | S1 `+0x0C`, city centre | 2 |
| `0x10` POI details | section 4 (8 B records) `+0`, the POI's road | 3 |
| `0x09` spatial-index cell | tile list | 1 |
| `0x04` house numbers | header `+12` | 1 |
| The tile itself | header `+0`; slot 10 (and slot 13) own-tile entries | 1 + 12 |

`0x03` slot 8 can also point at a `0x00` tile (not for this one), and `0x10` section 1
(20 B records) `+8` does for a few tiles. A tile's header points outwards at `+80` (its `0x04`
block) and `+84` (its `0x03` parent); those don't change when the tile moves.

#### 4.4.2 POI index of a city: `0x0C` sections 3 and 5

Checked on every `0x0C` block of CD-ID 2952 (618) and CD-ID 21594 (646); tested on a CNI1 with
CD-ID 2952 (2026-09-29, `local/tools/build_attempt25*.py`, `build_attempt26.py`). This answers
issue #21.

```
Section 3: one 12-byte range per POI category of a city (city record S1 +0x08 / +0x0A)

  +0x06 u16 count                     /
  +0x08 u16 CATEGORY   a 0x06 category code (02-geo.md §8.1)
  +0x0A u16 BRANDS     offset in this block of the category's first section 5 record
Section 5: one 12-byte range per brand of a category
  +0x00 u32 BLOCK_ID of a 0x11 block \  the brand's letter leaves, pointing into the brand
  +0x04 u16 offset                     |  copy (below)
  +0x06 u16 count                     /
  +0x08 u16 BRAND      offset of the brand name in this block's text (`bp`, `renault`)
  +0x0A u16 0
```

A category's brands run from its `BRANDS` to the next section 3 record's `BRANDS`. The section 3
records of all cities in a block follow each other, so a city's last category ends where the next
city's first begins. `BRANDS` never decreases and the first one is section 5's start: 605 / 605
blocks with a section 5 on CD-ID 2952 and 644 / 644 on CD-ID 21594; in the 11 blocks of CD-ID 2952
without a section 5, every `BRANDS` holds one value (no brands). On one city of CD-ID 2952, petrol
(12) has 13 brands (`bp` … `total`), hotels (21) have 10, and every other category none. All
91,620 section 5 records of CD-ID 21594 point at `0x11` blocks.

**Every branded POI is stored twice.** The *category copy* (reached from section 3) holds all of a
city's POIs, grouped by category and sorted by name. The *brand copy* (from section 5) holds the
branded ones again, grouped by category and brand. Brandless POIs are only in the category copy.
Each copy has its own detail and road-link records, with the same POI ID, position and road. On
CD-ID 2952, 83 of the 620 `0x10` blocks are reached from section 5; on CD-ID 21594, 522 of 4,787.

**How the unit finds a POI.** Through the city, the category (or brand), the leaf of the name's
first letter, and then the name within the leaf. Edits to real POIs on a CNI1, each on its own
petrol station, with the Guidance button as the test:

| Change | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Moved: the brand copy's detail X/Y and the `0x06` record | yes |
| The brand copy's road link (detail S4) pointed at another road | yes |
| Renamed in both copies, keeping the first letter and the name's place in the order | yes |
| Renamed in the brand copy only, in order | yes |
| Renamed so that the name is out of order in its leaf (one copy or both; also keeping the brand as the first word) | no |
| Renamed in both copies to a new first letter, in order, inside the old letter's leaf | no |
| As the last, with that leaf's letter changed in both `0x11` blocks | yes, and found by typing the name |

Renaming only the category copy out of order made the POI disappear from the unit's list. The unit
shows the brand in front of the name in its lists ("Gulf …"), and the locality (`0x10` S0 `+4`)
after the post-town initial on the address screen ("S.-LOCALITY", as for streets, §4.4.1).

**A POI index written from scratch works.** On the real map of CD-ID 2952 every real
POI was cut off: every city's and country's POI root set to `(0, 0)` and every `0x06` cell's
record count to 0. One city then got a new index: 16 made-up POIs in eight categories (petrol, car
rental, parking, hotels, restaurants, museums, landmarks, parks), four made-up brands and six
brandless POIs, on real roads of four `0x00` tiles, plain and packed (a link into a packed tile
gives the segment's offset in the decoded tile, as the disc's own links do). Written: the city's
section 3 and 5 ranges, its brand names (appended to the block's text), both `0x11` blocks, both
`0x10` copies (in place of real ones, keeping `+0x20` / `+0x24`, the next and previous `0x10`
block) and the `0x06` cell around them. On the unit every POI is listed, found by typing its name and
routed to. That includes brandless POIs, brands in categories that have none on the disc, and a
branded POI whose name doesn't start with its brand (like `savacentre` under `j sainsbury` on the
disc). Only the petrol and landmark icons were drawn on the map; which categories get icons looks
like the unit's own choice (not examined).

Rules a writer must keep:
1. In each leaf, the names are in order and all start with the leaf's letter; every first letter
   in a category (or brand) gets its own leaf, and the leaves are in letter order (on the discs:
   63,133 / 63,136 ranges on CD-ID 2952, 183,838 / 183,841 on CD-ID 21594; the exceptions were
   not examined).
2. The brand copy and section 5 follow the same rules.
3. The `0x06` records point at the copy the disc uses: on CD-ID 2952 the brand copy for every
   branded POI (11,643 / 11,643) and the category copy for the rest; on CD-ID 21594 the category
   copy for all (69,147 branded records). The test above followed CD-ID 2952.
4. Choosing a POI, unlike a street, also needs the road levels linked near the car
   (`03-road-network.md` §6.7).

### 4.6 `0x0C` — Administrative Parcel (CF=2 zlib)

The `0x0C` block contains administrative region geometry and localized toponyms, decompressed generically via zlib. It is actively requested and processed by the query engine (`dbc.asm:001c38` requests block type `0x0C` explicitly).

*   **S0 (8 bytes/record)**: Serves as a translation layer mapping the `C` field logical IDs (from `0x0E` S0 records) to metadata or node references.
*   **S1 (24 bytes/record)**: Hypothesis based on dimensions: represents the administrative hierarchy (e.g. Region -> City -> District). The 24-byte size suggests an OS-9 tree-node struct.
*   **S3 (12 bytes/record)**: Localized name mapping / metadata.
*   **Name Blob**: The final section of the block (likely S4 or S5) is hypothesized to hold the actual null-terminated string bytes, mirroring the structure used in `0x0E`.

### 4.7 `0x18`, `0x1A`, `0x1B` — TMC indexes (DVD only, 2026-09-29)

These three types are one-level sorted indexes over the two TMC block chains: `0x18` over
`0x17` (TMC location tables, keyed by location code) and `0x1B` → `0x1A` over `0x19`
(German TMC locations, keyed by position). Every field below not marked ❓ holds on every
block of DVD 21708 **and** DVD 21734 (`scripts/routing/check_tmc_index.py [--geometry]`,
0 failures on both). No firmware reader has been found (see "Firmware" below); the
evidence is the disc data, the linked `0x00` geometry and a published TMC table list.

```

```

**The data chains.** Both `0x17` and `0x19` form one doubly linked chain over all their
blocks: `+0x0C` next `BLOCK_ID`, `+0x10` previous (0 at the ends); S0 starts at `+0x1C`.

**`0x18` — location-table index (one block per table).**

```
+0x08 SECTION_DESCRIPTOR[1] = {0x0010, n}
+0x0C u16 TABLE              = (LTN << 4) | CC   (TMC location table number, RDS country code)
+0x0E u16 0

    the table's 0x17 blocks in chain order; the last record (counted in n) is the
    terminator {0, last location code + 1, 0}
```

The 13 tables together cover every `0x17` block once. The `0x07` SECTION_1 records
(§4.2) point to them:

```
0x07 SECTION_1 (20 B) -> ">IHHHBBHHHH"

The low nibble is the RDS country code of the country `0x07` gives for the table in all
13 cases. The published TMC table list (the `TMCINFO.ini` quoted in
[redsea issue #97](https://github.com/windytan/redsea/issues/97), file names
`country_CC_LTN_…`) gives the same CC and LTN for 12 of the 13; for the UK it lists LTN 7,
the disc LTN 10 (its first code also differs between the two DVDs: 32000 / 1). The same
list gives Germany's table the extent 47.387..55.017° N, the range of the `0x19` keys.

**`0x1A` — position index over `0x19`.**

```
+0x08 SECTION_DESCRIPTOR[1] = {0x0010, n}          (n = 279 / 282 = number of 0x19 blocks)
+0x0C u16 0x0104 ❓           +0x0E u16 0
S0: n records of 8 B -> ">Ihh"
      BLOCK_ID of a 0x19 block | its first key (x, y)
    every 0x19 block in chain order; then a terminator {0, last key} NOT counted in S0
```

**`0x1B` — root of the `0x19` index.** One block, one record of 22 B (the size of
`RECORD_SIZE_TABLE[0x9D]`):

```
+0x08 SECTION_DESCRIPTOR[1] = {0x000C, 1}
+0x0C u32 BLOCK_ID of the 0x1A block
+0x10 i16 x, i16 y           first key (= 0x1A S0[0])
+0x14 i32 X0, i32 Y0         key origin: 0x0E678A6A, 0x11627AEA = 13.5° E, 52.5° N
+0x1C u16 0x0104 ❓, u16 0x1000 ❓  (same values on both DVDs)
+0x20 u16 COUNTRY_ID          0x51 = de
```

The `0x07` layer directory (§4.2, `02-geo.md` §7.3) lists `0x1B` among the map layers,
with an all-zero root square and parameters: `0x19` is a georeferenced layer with its own
index instead of the quadtree.

**The `0x19` key is a position in 100 m steps.** With `φ`, `λ` the record's latitude and
longitude and `φ0`, `λ0` the `0x1B` origin, in radians:

```
y = round(R · (φ − φ0) / 100)
x = round(R · (λ − λ0) · cos φ / 100)        R ≈ 6,371 km (mean Earth radius)
```

Fitted on every record with a tile, against the midpoint of its linked `0x00` segment
(`--geometry`): R = 6,370,947 / 6,370,957 m (y / x, DVD 21708), 6,370,932 / 6,370,954 m
(DVD 21734), ±~35 m (2σ); intercept +0.01..+0.02 steps; residual sd 1.2 steps.
`cos φ0` instead of `cos φ` leaves a residual of 93 steps. The mean residual is within
±0.04 step for negative and for positive keys on both axes and both DVDs; truncation would
give −0.5 / +0.5, so the key is rounded to nearest. The fit does not separate
6,371,000 m from radii within ~50 m of it. Sorting `x` as unsigned puts the east half
(0..1052) before the west half (−5317..−1).

**Firmware.** No reader found. Checked and not block readers: the RR (`bsw2`) `hdltmc`
switch at `+0x2f620` compares its argument with 1, 2, 5–7, 0x10–0x15, 0x17–0x1B and 0x2A
on double-precision arguments and stores `0x7FF00000` (IEEE infinity); the 0x17..0x1B
immediates in `dbc` are the third argument of a call with `0x198, 0xE` (the error path);
the 4996 at `dbd +0x9370` is a PIC prologue offset. No module
holds the scale as a literal: no float or double in 1110..1114 (100 m/°), 111,000..111,400
(m/°), 6.36..6.38e6 (R), 0.0174 (°→rad) as a data word or as a `lui`/`ori` pair, and no
matching integer immediate. `db_pub`, `db_bh_read` and `dbd` have no dedicated handler (the
blocks are CF=0 or CF=2).

## 5. Text Encoding (Name Table)

**Verified**: no character compression, no custom charset (for uncompressed text;
CF=1 blocks use a dedicated prefix encoder — see [`04-cf1-codec.md`](04-cf1-codec.md) §9.11.5).

* Encoding: **ISO-8859-1 / Latin-1**.
  `0xF6 = ö` ("österreich"), `0xEB = ë` ("belgië"), `0xF1 = ñ` ("españa"), `0xED = í`.
* All strings are **lowercase** (uppercase rendering is done by firmware).
* Terminator: `0x00`. Strings are packed into contiguous blobs at block end.
* Retrieval: records point to the blob with a `u16` offset relative to the current block
  (used in `0x0C`/`0x0E` parcels).

> **RESOLVED (2026-09-28, PR #13)**: there is no 32-bit `NAME_PTR` with a segment half. The
> country record in `0x0A` starts with a `u32 BLOCK_ID`, `u16 offset`, `u16 count`: the root of the
> country's `0x0D` city-name trie (§4.4, §4.4.1). Read at `+0x02`, those bytes look like

```python
def carin_str(buf: bytes, off: int) -> str:
    end = buf.index(b"\x00", off)
    return buf[off:end].decode("latin-1")

def encode_carin_str(s: str) -> bytes:
    return s.lower().encode("latin-1", errors="replace") + b"\x00"
```

### Where names live (index)

| Type | Textual content |
|---|---|
| `0x0C`, `0x0E` | toponyms / municipalities (≈3,600 distinct strings per sample) |
| `0x10`, `0x17`, `0x19` | odonyms (street names) |
| `0x15` | municipalities / hamlets |
| `0x16` | islands, lakes, watercourses, city labels |
| `0x14`, `0x1C`, `0x1D`, `0x1E` | seas, oceans, regions, major cities (multilingual) |
| `0x06` | POI brands |
| `0x07`, `0x0A` | country names |

## Note on 0x00 vs 0x0E Geometry
The database splits the road network into two distinct layers to save runtime memory:
1. **0x0E (street-name directory)**: Maps each street name (and locality) to runs of road segments in `0x00` tiles, with house-number ranges. It stores no geometry and no topology of its own (see `03-road-network.md` §6.3.1; the earlier "routing graph / bounding boxes" reading came from treating house numbers as coordinate deltas).
2. **0x00 (Map Drawing)**: Contains the high-resolution, continuous polylines for actual map rendering on the LCD. Loaded dynamically only for regions currently on screen.
