**OpenCarin** is an open-source reverse-engineering and map compilation toolkit for the proprietary **Philips/VDO CARiN** navigation database format (`CARINdb`, `DB_0`, `DB_1`, `CARINET`).

These navigation databases were widely used in iconic late 1990s and 2000s automotive systems, including:
* **BMW Navigation Systems**: MK3 (CD, MIPS32) and MK4 (DVD, Hitachi SH-4) across BMW E46, E39, E38, X5 E53, Z4 E85
  *(On the BMW update CD `NAV_SW(v32).iso` the DVD database reader and route planner are MIPS32 — the VDO Dayton "RoadRunner" software; see [docs/fw/03-firmware-provenance.md](docs/fw/03-firmware-provenance.md).)*
* **Renault / Nissan**: Carminat Navigation Informée 1 (CNI1)
* **VDO Dayton**: PC5000, PC5200, MS5000 series
* Systems across Opel/Vauxhall, Rover, Land Rover, Volkswagen/Audi and others

Official map updates ceased years ago (mostly frozen around 2015–2019). **The mission of this project is to reverse-engineer the CARiN binary format and build a compiler pipeline that converts modern OpenStreetMap (OSM) data into functional, bootable DVD/CD navigation discs for these classic cars.**

## 🧭 Current Project Status & Key Breakthroughs

We have achieved major breakthroughs across the entire format specification. Every technical finding below is byte-verified on real disc images (e.g. BMW High 2015 `NAV_DB_21708.ISO`, 2019 `NAV_DB_21734.bin`, and CD-IDs 2952 / 21594):

* ✅ **Addressing & Block Chaining Solved (100% File Coverage)**:
  * **DVD** (BMW MK4): The sector size is **512 bytes**, and the virtual address space spans `DB_0` (first 2 GiB) and `DB_1` via `virtual_sector = file_index * 0x400000 + local_sector`.
  * **CD** (e.g. Carminat CNI1): The database is a single `/carindb` file and the unit is **2048 bytes**.
  * The disc's `ABSTRACT` names the unit: `carinet16s512` on `NAV_DB_21708`, `carinet16s2048` on CD-ID 21594.
  * The block chain covers **100% of the volume with zero gaps** (315,095 blocks on DVD 21708).
  * `/CARINET` identified as the RDS-TMC ALERT-C event and weather phrase catalog across 8–9 European languages.
* ✅ **Coordinate System Cracked**:
  $$X = (lon + 30.0) \times \frac{2 \times 10^9}{360}, \quad Y = (lat + 0.0) \times \frac{2 \times 10^9}{360}$$
  Origin is at $30^\circ\text{ W}$ on the Equator, linear in latitude (no Mercator projection). 1 unit $\approx 2\text{ cm}$ at the equator. Verified with 38 European city anchors (RMS error $2.0\text{ km}$, matching published city-center offsets).
* ✅ **Hierarchical Spatial Index Fully Cracked (`0x07` → `0x08` → `0x09`)**:
  * Block `0x07` contains the 12-layer directory and quadtree root bounding box.
  * Layer parameters decoded via RoadRunner firmware (`dbq 0x21270`, `rpmod 0x7490c`): parameter 0 defines the highest allowed road class for road layers `0x00`–`0x03`.
  * Quadtree grid partitioned into consecutive `0x08` blocks.
  * Column-major cell matrix in `0x09` points directly to map and feature tile blocks.
  * Implemented in [`carin/parser/spatial.py`](carin/parser/spatial.py) (`tiles_at`), reaching **100% of all tiles** on both DVD 21708 (128,690/128,690) and DVD 21734 (144,143 tiles).
* ✅ **100% of CF=1 Bit-Packed Blocks Decoded Across Entire Discs**:
  Covering 30% of all disc blocks (96,011 blocks), this was **not a dictionary compression codec** but **structure-driven bit-packing** parameterized by the superblock's `RECORD_SIZE_TABLE`. Decoders recovered from RoadRunner MIPS32 (`db_pub`) and CC-93 m68k (`pbp`) firmware:
  * **Map tiles (`0x00`)**: **100% decoded without error** (86,107/86,107 on DVD 21708, and 91,651/91,651 on DVD 21734). Solved by identifying the pass `0x15` sentinel and pass `0x1B` (`+0x18`) from RoadRunner `db_pub` (`sub_005e6c`).
  * **Background feature layers (`0x14`–`0x16`, `0x1C`–`0x1E`)**: Sea, forest, built-up areas, rivers, rail across all zoom levels decoded via RoadRunner `sub_004b88`. Oracle qualified on 20,227 plain blocks and passes 100% of CF=1 blocks on both DVDs, including legacy DB-REL < 23 discs.
  * **Street-name directory (`0x0E`)**: Packed name blobs fully decoded and re-encoded byte-perfect (`enc_text`).
* ✅ **Road Network Graph Architecture Cracked (Major Paradigm Shift)**:
  * **`0x0E` is the Street-Name Directory, NOT the routing graph**: It maps street names, alternative names, languages, and localities to runs of segments in `0x00`, providing the envelope of house-number ranges.
  * **The True Routing Graph is in `0x00`–`0x03` (Section 4)**: Contains topological start/end nodes, next-segment adjacency lists (falsifying the older "BSP tree" hypothesis), inter-tile boundary crossings (Section 6 twins), level transitions (Section 8), road class hierarchy (0–7), speed codes, one-way flags, length, bearings, signposts, and turn restrictions (Section 10; U-turn bans are entries whose target is the owner segment itself). Confirmed by RoadRunner route planner (`sub_01fd80`).
* ✅ **Per-Segment House Numbers Decoded (`0x04` & `0x0E` S2)**:
  * Block `0x04` stores 10-byte records defining left/right house number ranges per S4 road segment (implemented in [`carin/parser/house_numbers.py`](carin/parser/house_numbers.py)).
  * `0x0E` S2 holds street-level envelope ranges, cross-checked with a **98.9% match against OpenStreetMap addresses**.
* ✅ **Administrative Search Tries & Physical Hardware Verification (`0x0A`, `0x0C`, `0x0D`, `0x0F`, `0x11`)**:
  * Country table (`0x0A`), city records (`0x0C` with exact city-center coordinates), and prefix radix tries for cities (`0x0D`) and roads (`0x0F`). POIs (`0x11`) use a first-letter index per city, category and brand (`0x0C` sections 3 and 5).
  * **Live vehicle verification**: Modified street names and a custom created city were injected into disc images and successfully booted and recognized on a physical Renault Carminat CNI1 nav computer!
* ✅ **Our Own Roads and POIs Run on a CNI1** (CD-ID 2952):
  * Plain `0x00` road tiles written from our own records draw, route and give turn-by-turn guidance, also on a disc whose other road tiles are all empty. Their coarse `0x03`/`0x02`/`0x01` parents, written by us, draw when zoomed out.
  * A city's POI index written from scratch (`0x06`, `0x10`, `0x11`, `0x0C` sections 3 and 5): made-up POIs, with and without brands, are listed, found by name and routed to. See [`01-architecture.md`](docs/carindb/01-architecture.md) §4.4.2 and [`03-road-network.md`](docs/carindb/03-road-network.md) §6.7.
* ✅ **TMC Traffic Message Channel Indices Decoded (`0x17`–`0x1B`)**:
  * TMC location tables (`0x17`), table index (`0x18`), TMC position records (`0x19`), and spherical coordinate spatial index (`0x1B` → `0x1A`).
* ✅ **High-Performance Rust Toolchain (`carindb-rs`)**:
  * Fast native CLI tool with memory-mapped ISO access, ultra-fast CF=2 zlib and full CF=1 bit-packing decoders, supporting `dump-type`, `stats`, and disc-wide `xref` cross-referencing.

## 🛠 Current Roadmap & Focus Areas ("The Heavy Lifting")

With the reading and decoding of the binary format solved, our focus is shifted towards routing semantics, export tools, and the OpenStreetMap compiler pipeline:

### 1. RoadRunner Firmware Route Planner & Cost Functions 🔴 Critical
* Reverse-engineer the routing engine in RoadRunner MIPS firmware (`bsw2` / `sub_01fd80`, `sub_04e02c`).
* Decode speed code lookup tables (`+0x0A & 0x1F`), turn restriction weights (Section 10), and routing cost traversal heuristics.
* Trace inter-tile crossing logic (Section 6 twins) and hierarchical layer transitions (Section 8) in the firmware. On the data side the levels are known: which street roads and nodes reach `0x03`/`0x02`/`0x01` and how coarse segments are built ([`03-road-network.md`](docs/carindb/03-road-network.md) §6.7); still open are the ~4% of runs the disc leaves out and how coarse shapes are simplified.

### 2. Routable Export Pipeline (GeoPackage / OSRM / Valhalla) 🟠 High
* ✅ Street level (`0x00`) segments, nodes, geometry, one-ways, turn bans, names and speeds export to GeoPackage, CSV and OSM XML (`scripts/routing/export_routable.py`, [`examples/05_routable_export`](examples/05_routable_export)); `osrm-extract` reads the result and honours the bans. Checked on a CD against OSM and OSRM ([`03-road-network.md`](docs/carindb/03-road-network.md) §6.7).
* ✅ Signposts (S11), the coarse levels `0x01`–`0x03` (each coarse segment resolved to its street path) and the `0x04` house numbers are layers of the same export, decoded on all cores; section 13 entries come as a neutral `marks` layer (they are not toll points on a CD without tolls, [`03-road-network.md`](docs/carindb/03-road-network.md) §6.7).
* Still open: what the section 13 marks are, Valhalla, a whole-disc export (the export is region-based), and a check on a DVD.

### 3. OpenStreetMap to CARiN Serializer & ISO Compiler 🟡 Ongoing
* **Block Serializers**: Generate `0x00`–`0x03` road network tiles from OSM ways and nodes. The units read plain (CF=0) tiles, but a CD needs CF=1 packing to stay under ~700 MB (all-plain `carindb` would be ~509 MB for CD-ID 2952 and ~640 MB for CD-ID 21594, against 322 and 437 MB packed); `encode_type00` and `encode_type0E` exist. Hand-built plain tiles, their coarse parents and a city's POI index already run on a CNI1; the rules they need are in [`03-road-network.md`](docs/carindb/03-road-network.md) §6.7 and [`01-architecture.md`](docs/carindb/01-architecture.md) §4.4.2.
* **Spatial Index Builder**: Generate quadtree directory `0x07` → grid `0x08` → cell matrix `0x09`.
* **Administrative Hierarchy & Tries**: Compile country table `0x0A`, city directory `0x0C`, and search tries `0x0D` / `0x0F` / `0x11`. The `0x0F` build rule and the `0x11` POI index are known and tested on a CNI1; `0x0D`'s split rule is still open.
* **Disc Masterer**: Package 512-byte sector-aligned `DB_0` / `DB_1` files and generate bootable dual-layer ISO 9660 filesystem images.

### 4. Residual Decoders & Legacy Formats 🟢 Minor
* Determine left/right orientation and start/end node assignments of `0x04` house numbers.
* Investigate residual trailer fields in `0x07` (`+0x164`) and legacy variations on DB-REL < 34 discs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Rust toolchain (optional, for `carindb-rs` high-performance tools)
* Access to a CARiN disc dump (e.g. BMW High MK4 `NAV_DB_*.ISO`) in `dataset/`

### 2. Dataset (Navigation ISOs & Firmware)

Due to file sizes and licensing restrictions, disc dumps cannot be hosted directly in this repository. Research map disc dumps (e.g. `NAV_DB_21708.ISO`, `NAV_DB_21734.bin`) and firmware images (`NAV_SW(v32).iso`) can be downloaded here:

📁 **[Download Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KZH93y9ltZBkkjlIm-hBnoqKcCdnsqJa?usp=sharing)**

Place them (or symlinks) in the `dataset/` folder at project root:
```bash
mkdir -p dataset
# Place NAV_DB_21708.ISO into dataset/
```

### 3. Python Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fdemusso/OpenCarin.git
cd OpenCarin

# Using uv (recommended)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or using standard python venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 4. Inspecting Database Blocks & Spatial Lookup

```python
from carin.parser.iso import IsoImage, CarinVolume, to_wgs84
from carin.parser.spatial import tiles_at
from carin.parser.house_numbers import segment_house_numbers

# Open ISO image (virtual sector space DB_0 + DB_1)
vol = CarinVolume(IsoImage('dataset/NAV_DB_21708.ISO'))

# Query spatial index: which street tile covers a coordinate? (e.g. Milan: 9.19° E, 45.46° N)
tiles = tiles_at(vol, layer=0, lon=9.1900, lat=45.4600)
print(f"Tiles covering location: {[hex(b) for b in tiles]}")

# Read and decode a tile block
if tiles:
    blk = vol.block(tiles[0] >> 8)
    print(f"Block Sector: {blk.sector}, Type: {blk.type:#04x}, CF: {blk.comp}")
    print(f"Decompressed Payload Length: {len(blk.payload)} bytes")
    
    lon, lat = to_wgs84(blk.bbox.x_min, blk.bbox.y_min)
    print(f"Bounding Box SW Corner: {lat:.4f}° N, {lon:.4f}° E")
```

### 5. High-Performance Rust CLI (`carindb-rs`)

For fast exploration across multi-gigabyte ISOs:

```bash
cd carindb-rs

# Mass-dump all decoded blocks of a specific type (e.g. 0x18 TMC index)
cargo run --release -- --iso ../dataset/NAV_DB_21708.ISO dump-type 0x18 --out ./dump_0x18

# Compute cross-instance byte statistics for a block type
cargo run --release -- --iso ../dataset/NAV_DB_21708.ISO stats 0x0A

# Search for all occurrences of a BLOCK_ID across all decoded blocks in one pass
cargo run --release -- --iso ../dataset/NAV_DB_21708.ISO xref 0x00000304
```

### 6. Running Tests

```bash
# Run Python test suite
uv run --with pytest pytest

# Run Rust test suite
cargo test --manifest-path carindb-rs/Cargo.toml
```
